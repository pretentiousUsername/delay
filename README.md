# Delay
> A hugo complement for my [pandoc theme][quetzal].

Delay is based off of [XMin][xmin], an extremely simple Hugo theme. So far,
the theme has a *minimal* feature set, including math rendering, rough
responsive design, and more. Delay is made for blogging, personal websites, and
moreâ€”it supports taxonomies, but not to the extent you would see in other
themes; I'll work on that eventually.
