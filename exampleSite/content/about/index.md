Typesetting is art, both in the sense that is beautiful, and that it is 
useful. Beauty is of course in the eye of the beholder---it is derived
from many things; while *The Fountain* is a urinal, and not a Baroque
painting, its use in demonstrating the art world's hypocrisy was beautiful in 
and of itself. In essence, *The Fountain*'s beauty derived from its
function---in essence, *The Fountain* is a masterclass in modern design.

For most people, that works perfectly, but typesetters are not so lucky.
Typography's beauty doesn't derive from process, message, or raw 
aesthetics---it is instead from how easy a document can be read, and 
whether or not the style matches the medium and purpose. If I were to 
print a document, with *massive* comic sans, on printer paper that says 
"***DO YOU'RE BEST :))))***," and handed it out to everyone in my 
neighborhood, people would find it ridiculous; if I were to print that in 
Garamond, and place it in a book a thousand times *a-la The Shining*, 
people would think I'm a serial killer. If I put it on a poster, in bright 
Frutiger or Helveitca, give it some contrasting colors, and hang it up in 
some bar in a gentrified part of New York or Philadelphia people would call it 
graphic design---if I'm lucky, they'd call it art.

To make good typesetting, you need to know your purpose. This template is
designed to do two things: make your information look decent, and make it 
readable. If you're not writing "***DO YOU'rE BESt***" a thousand times, 
you're on route to making something good. Not only is this designed to
make whatever you're writing look good, it's also trying to make it as
timeless as possible. I avoided design trends---I avoided those puffy
serif fonts, such as [New Spirit][ns]. This is a hugo template for
websites that matter, not advertising that will wind up in the dustbin of 
history.[^ads]


![Brand, online pharmacy and menstrual underwear company. We care enough
about you to use desaturated colors and lowercase letters. \*we might
put PFAS in your underwear.](img/brand.webp)


This template was created with two goals in mind: I wanted to make something
with as little code as possible---one that I betrayed given how much CSS and
shortcodes I used---and I wanted to make something that was a compliment to
my pandoc template, [*Quetzalcoatl*][quet]. Delay is designed to be as nice
as possible to read, and as simple to use as possible---it is human scale,
and human oriented.

There is still quite a bit of work to be done, of course. I still need to:
+ Add tags/categories,
+ Clean up some css,
+ Test on various platforms,
+ Get this on the hugo showcase website.

If you use *delay* for your website, feel free to let me know somehow---no
pressure, but it would definitely be cool.

[^ads]: I've always found my taste runs, for the most part, contrary to 
advertisement---if I see some font in a commercial, or on the packaging for 
some personal wellness product, I avoid it like the plague. Maybe I'm a weird
contrarian, or perhaps I'm an *avant-garde* god. Who can say, really?
