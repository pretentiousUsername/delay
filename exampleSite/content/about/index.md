Typesetting is art, both in the sense that is beautiful, and that it is 
useful. Beauty is of course in the eye of the beholder---it is derived
from many things; while *The Fountain* is a urinal, and not a Baroque
painting, its use in demonstrating the hypocrisy in the wider avant-garde
art world was beautiful in and of itself. In essence, the beauty derived
from the function of the object---that is much of art in and of itself.
What is aesthetically beautiful---what we find easy on the eyes---is
culturally defined.

For most people, that works perfectly, but typesetters are not so lucky. 
Typography's beauty doesn't derive from process, message, or raw 
aesthetics---it is instead from how easy a document can be read, and 
whether or not the style matches the medium and purpose. If I were to 
print a document, with *massive* comic sans, on printer paper that says 
"***DO YOU'RE BEST :))))***," and handed it out to everyone in my 
neighborhood, people would find it ridiculous; if I were to print that in 
Garamond, and place it in a book a thousand times *a-la The Shining*, 
people would think I'm a serial killer. If I put it on a poster, in bright 
Frutiger or Helveitca, give it some contrasting colors, and hang it up in 
some bar in a gentrified part of New York or Philadelphia---and maybe throw
in a picture of an possum---people would call it graphic design---if I'm 
lucky, they'd call it art.

To make good typesetting, you need to know your purpose. This template is
designed to do two things: make your information look decent, and make it 
readable. If you're not writing "***DO YOU'rE BESt***" a thousand times, 
you're on route to making something good. Not only is this designed to
make whatever you're writing look good, it's also trying to make it as
timeless as possible. I avoided design trends---I avoided those puffy
serif fonts, such as [New Spirit][ns]. This is a pandoc template for
typesetting documents that matter, not advertising that will wind up
in the dustbin of history, relegated to simply being a marker of the times.

This template was created for a simple reason: I'm sick and tired of
Computer Modern and Times (New Roman). I see a lot of good scientists
typesetting their documents in Computer Modern---and if they're using Word,
Times New Roman---and I have to just ask *why*? The backbone of modern
science---the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org)---puts all of its documents in
plain LaTeX. (Either that, or they're horribly typeset in MS
Word.) That's fine, but I think it can be done better. If you're going to be 
making non-choices, then you might as well make them look nice and print well.
