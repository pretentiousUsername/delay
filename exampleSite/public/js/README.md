Javascript files for KaTeX. Sorry you wandered in hereâ€”maybe John will give you
the tour on what rack space this js will take up.

The plan is to eventually have KaTeX just sit in the repo, rather than call for
[jsDelivr][jsd], which I think has the potential to cause a lot of problems in
the future.
