	<p>Typesetting is art, both in the sense that is beautiful, and that it is
useful. Beauty is of course in the eye of the beholder&mdash;it is derived
from many things; while <em>The Fountain</em> is a urinal, and not a Baroque
painting, its use in demonstrating the art world&rsquo;s hypocrisy was beautiful in
and of itself. In essence, <em>The Fountain</em>&rsquo;s beauty derived from its
function&mdash;in essence, <em>The Fountain</em> is a masterclass in modern design.</p>
<p>For most people, that works perfectly, but typesetters are not so lucky.
Typography&rsquo;s beauty doesn&rsquo;t derive from process, message, or raw
aesthetics&mdash;it is instead from how easy a document can be read, and
whether or not the style matches the medium and purpose. If I were to
print a document, with <em>massive</em> comic sans, on printer paper that says
&ldquo;<em><strong>DO YOU&rsquo;RE BEST :))))</strong></em>,&rdquo; and handed it out to everyone in my
neighborhood, people would find it ridiculous; if I were to print that in
Garamond, and place it in a book a thousand times <em>a-la The Shining</em>,
people would think I&rsquo;m a serial killer. If I put it on a poster, in bright
Frutiger or Helveitca, give it some contrasting colors, and hang it up in
some bar in a gentrified part of New York or Philadelphia people would call it
graphic design&mdash;if I&rsquo;m lucky, they&rsquo;d call it art.</p>

<p>To make good typesetting, you need to know your purpose. This template is
designed to do two things: make your information look decent, and make it
readable. If you&rsquo;re not writing &ldquo;<em><strong>DO YOU&rsquo;rE BESt</strong></em>&rdquo; a thousand times,
you&rsquo;re on route to making something good. Not only is this designed to
make whatever you&rsquo;re writing look good, it&rsquo;s also trying to make it as
timeless as possible. I avoided design trends&mdash;I avoided those puffy
serif fonts, such as <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/new-spirit">New Spirit</a>. This is a hugo template for
websites that matter, not advertising that will wind up in the dustbin of
history.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p><figure>
    <img src="img/brand.webp"
	 alt="Brand, online pharmacy and menstrual underwear company. We care enough
about you to use desaturated colors and lowercase letters. *we might
put PFAS in your underwear."
	 position="center"
    />
</figure>
</p>
<p>This template was created with two goals in mind: I wanted to make something
with as little code as possible&mdash;one that I betrayed given how much CSS and
shortcodes I used&mdash;and I wanted to make something that was a compliment to
my pandoc template, <a href="https://github.com/pretentiousUsername/quetzalcoatl"><em>Quetzalcoatl</em></a>. Delay is designed to be as nice
as possible to read, and as simple to use as possible&mdash;it is human scale,
and human oriented.</p>
<p>There is still quite a bit of work to be done, of course. I still need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add tags/categories,</li>
<li>Clean up some css,</li>
<li>Test on various platforms,</li>
<li>Get this on the hugo showcase website.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use <em>delay</em> for your website, feel free to let me know somehow&mdash;no
pressure, but it would definitely be cool.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always found my taste runs, for the most part, contrary to
advertisement&mdash;if I see some font in a commercial, or on the packaging for
some personal wellness product, I avoid it like the plague. Maybe I&rsquo;m a weird
contrarian, or perhaps I&rsquo;m an <em>avant-garde</em> god. Who can say, really?&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
